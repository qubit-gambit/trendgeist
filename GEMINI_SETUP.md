## ðŸ“ˆ Usage Examples

The AI will provide insights like:

**CPI Analysis:**
> "The current CPI reading of 3.2% with an increasing trend suggests persistent inflationary pressures above the Fed's 2% target. This level typically prompts continued monetary tightening discussions. Watch for core CPI excluding food and energy for underlying inflation momentum."

**Coaching Insight:**
> "Your 85% confidence level is quite high given the current CPI volatility. Consider moderating to 65-70% confidence as inflation data has shown increased month-to-month variability. This calibration adjustment could improve your scoring potential."
